## What is RabbitMQ?

RabbitMQ is a message queue system. (Similar message queue systems: Azure Queue Storage / Azure Service Bus / Kafka ) It transmits the messages it receives from one source to another source when and where appropriate.

It provides a better user experience by easing the workload of the application in processes with long Request-Response times.

It provides asynchronous communication in microservice architectures.
